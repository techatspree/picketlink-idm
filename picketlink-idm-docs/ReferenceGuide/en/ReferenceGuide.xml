            <para>PicketLink IDM aims to provide a common identity model for various JBoss projects.
                As every project has it's own specific needs it's hard to design a common API and identity model that will
                fit all of them. Therefore PicketLink IDM architecture consists of two main parts:</para>

                Too much abstraction in the API layer would confuse people using the framework.
                One of the goals is to make the design easily extendible. Framework adopters should be able to remove the
                API layer and reuse core SPI implementation if needed.

        <chapter id="group_and_roles">
            <title>Groups and Roles</title>
            <para>
                Groups are entities that can contain other group or identity objects. They can be associated in a tree
                like organizational structures. Those don't need to be hierarchical only as single group can be a member
                of many other groups (can have many parents). Possible relationships between groups are shaped with group
                types. It can be configured which different group types can be associated or even which group types can
                or can not contain identity objects. Groups have unique names per group type. This means you can have
                two groups with the same name but different group type.
            </para>
            <para>
                Roles are direct typed connections between Identity and Group objects. If you think about a sentence:
                "<emphasis role="bold">John</emphasis> is the <emphasis role="bold">Manager</emphasis> of
                <emphasis role="bold">XX Team"</emphasis> what matters is the context. So "John (Identity) is the Manager (RoleType)
                of XX Team (Group)". The whole sentence describes the Role that John has. This type of information is hard
                to map with typical Group object as John can be a manager of several different groups and other identities
                (Marry, Jack, Stan...) can have the same RoleType in context of different groups (XY Team, YY Team).
                Within each Realm (concept of Realms is described later) we can define several RoleType objects with
                unique names. Each Role defines a unique combination of Identity, Group and RoleType within Realm.
                Role concept is very powerful but its not natural in all identity store types. While quite easy to map in
                a relational database it doesn't fit into every LDAP tree present in organizations. Because of this Role
                support is optional in the API level

            <para>
                Model described above is very flexible as IdentityObjectType is able to map any kind of entities.
                Identity object and Group/GroupType objects are only one of many possible options (API is a subset of
                SPI possibilities). IdentityObjectRelationship defines a connection between any two IdentityObject
                objects. Each IdentityObjectRelationship has a type. To map previously described API two
                IdentityObjectRelationshipType objects are needed. One to map normal MEMBERSHIP like between an Identity
                and a Group or Group and Group objects. Second one to map Role concept. For API Role - RoleType refers
                to the name of the IdentityObjectRelationship. In default Hibernate implementation possible names of
                IdentityObjectRelationship are kept in a separate table. All of those can be easily redefined to support
                different kind of API.

        <chapter>
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>The most confusing part of the framework is probably connection between API and SPI. This part will
                try to explain how operations on API model are translated into the SPI. It will also enable to
                dive in the API and framework capabilities by looking on realcode examples

            <title>User and Group</title>
            <para>
               Objects represented by User and Group interfaces are managed by PersistenceManager.
                In the example below 3 users and 4 groups are created.
            </para>
            <programlisting role="java">
PersistenceManager pm = identitySession.getPersistenceManager();
User johnUser = pm.createUser("John");
User annUser = pm.createUser("Ann");
User stefanUser = pm.createUser("Stefan");

String OFFICE = "OFFICE";
String DEPARTMENT = "DEPARTMENT";

Group parisOffice = pm.createGroup("Paris", OFFICE);
Group atlantaOffice = pm.createGroup("Atlanta", OFFICE);

assertEquals(OFFICE, parisOffice.getGroupType());

Group itDep = pm.createGroup("IT", DEPARTMENT);
Group hrDep = pm.createGroup("HR", DEPARTMENT);
            </programlisting>
            <para>
               At the SPI level both Group and User are mapped as IdentityObject. What differentiate them is the
                IdentityObjectType. IdentityObjectType "USER" is mapped to represent User objects while other are
                mapped to represent different Group types names.

            <title>Associations</title>
            <para>Group and Users can be associated. This represents simple relationship that can be described like
                "user John belongs to Group IT". Association can be created between Group and User or between two Groups.</para>
            <para>Those operations are managed by RelationshipManager:</para>
            <programlisting role="java">
RelationshipManager rm = identitySession.getRelationshipManager();

rm.associateUser(parisOffice, annUser);
rm.associateUser(atlantaOffice, stefanUser);
rm.associateUser(itDep, stefanUser);

assertTrue(rm.isAssociated(parisOffice, annUser));
            </programlisting>
            <para>
                At the SPI level this is mapped to IdentityObjectRelationship entity. This relationship has a type.
                Simple assotiations can be marked with a type named "JBOSS_IDENTITY_MEMBERSHIP"
                (this is implementation detail) which describes simple membership. Note that IdentityObjectRelationship
                creates a connection between any two IdentityObject entities.

        <chapter>
            <title>Role</title>
            <para>Roles are direct typed connections between Identity and Group objects. If you think about a sentence:
                "John is the Manager of XX Team" what matters is the context. So "John (Identity) is the Manager
                (RoleType) of XX Team (Group)". The whole sentence describes the Role that John has. This type of
                information is hard to map with typical Group object as John can be a manager of several different
                groups and other identities (Marry, Jack, Stan...) can have the same RoleType in context of different
                groups (XY Team, YY Team). Within each Realm (concept of Realms is described later) we can define
                several RoleType objects with unique names. Each Role defines a unique combination of Identity, Group
                and RoleType within Realm.</para>
            <para>
                Roles are managed with RoleManager interface:
            </para>
            <programlisting role="java">
RoleManager roleManager = identitySession.getRoleManager();

roleManager.createRoleType("manager");
RoleType adminRT = roleManager.createRoleType("administrator");

Role role1 = roleManager.createRole("manager", annUser.getId(), parisOffice.getId());
roleManager.createRole(adminRT, stefanUser, itDep);

assertTrue(roleManager.hasRole(stefanUser, itDep, adminRT));
                
            </programlisting>
            <para>
                At the SPI level the main difference between plain association is that IdentityObjectRelationship has
                a IdentityObjectRelationshipName which is simple mapping of a RoleType used in the API
            </para>
            <mediaobject>

                    <imagedata fileref="images/SPI3.png" contentwidth="6in"

            <para>
                What is important to note about the Role concept is that it is not natural in all kinds of
                identity stores. Entities represented on attached figures are easy to map in the database.
                However in store like LDAP typical relationships are represanted in a more plain manner. For example:
            </para>
            <programlisting>

            </programlisting>
            <para>
                The whole relationship between User "admin" and Group "Administrators" is described by one attribute
                value ("member"). In such typical LDAP tree shape there is no place to store additional
                information that are needed to describe Role shown above. Obviously it is possible to shape
                LDAP tree in a way that will allow such a mapping but in most cases it is not possible to
                redesign already used LDAP server tree.

            <para>
                One of the best ways to get familiar with the PicketLink IDM component is to look at the source code.
                You will find link to the subversion repository in the project webpage.
                There are couple of quite meaningful testcases there. One of the best to start with is
                org.picketlink.idm.impl.api.OrganizationTest under 'idm-testsuite' module . It contains two example identity structures.
                One mapping hierarchical organization of Red Hat and JBoss projects and the other describes theoretical
                portal tree for ACME company.

                As PicketLink IDM is a Maven2 based project it is very easy to leverage it from this build system.
                There is a ready to use Maven2 example project in the svn. It contains three sample test cases for with
                following configurations:

                Framework configuration can be defined in two ways. It can be passed as implementation of a set of
                metadata interfaces grouped in org.picketlink.idm.spi.configuration.metadata package. Main one
                is IdentityConfigurationMetaData.
            </para>
            <para>
                Other possibility is to use xml configuration file that will be unmarshaled into JAXB model
                (org.picketlink.idm.impl.configuration.jaxb2.generated package) and used to create
                IdentityConfigurationMetaData object. XML configuration is described by identity-config.xsd file.
                It is good to take a look at the example organization-test-config.xml that is used in the testsuite.

                <para> HibernateIdentityStoreImpl maps PicketLink IDM SPI model into Hibernate entities.
                    This enables to use any RDBMS supported by Hibernate as identity persistence store (IdentityStore).
                    Because of flexibility that ORM gives this IdentityStore implementation support all of the optional
                    design concepts like role management. It can be used as the default IdentityStore together with other
                    more limited implementations. For example in combination with LDAP IdentityStore it can handle
                    IdentityObject attributes that are not supported in LDAP schema. In such configuration part of
                    IdentityObject profile will be stored in LDAP and part in relational database. To learn more about
                    such setup please read FallbackIdentityStoreRepository documentation. In current version
                    implementation doesn't have any caching mechanism besides of what can be set in hibernate
                    configuration</para>

          <para>The main role of configuration is to define relationship between separate framework components. It also
          enables to specify a lot of meta data information describing possible connections between IdentityObject types.
          It is however possible to not define all those meta data information and let the framework to be maximum permissive
          about allowed operations and lazily create not defined types:</para>

            For the 1st case, users need to use the API to start the IdentitySessionFactory, and then use it.
            The code is as following, which you can find on the example module.
         </para>
         <programlisting>
            <![CDATA[
IdentitySessionFactory identitySessionFactory = new IdentityConfigurationImpl().
   configure(new File("src/test/resources/example-db-config.xml")).buildIdentitySessionFactory();
IdentitySession identitySession = identitySessionFactory.createIdentitySession("realm://JBossIdentityExample/SampleRealm");            
            ]]>
         </programlisting>
         <para>
            And then use the IdentitySession to do the operations etc. So it is very easy to use. We will look closer
            at the second scenario in the next chapter

         <title>JBoss AS 5 Deployment</title>
         <para>Now, lets look at the second case, by deploying the idm into the JBoss AS 5. By doing this different
            services can share the identity component, instead of having its own seperate identity component.</para>
         <para>The jobs that need to be done for the deployment in the container is quite simple:</para>
         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Populate the idm schema if neccessary.
               </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Start the IdentitySessionFactory, and then register it into the JNDI.
               </para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
         <para>
            Before we look at it further, lets see the configuration files that jboss idm needed typically.
            (Say using db back-end, hibernate impl combination)
         </para>
         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>jboss idm configuration file. say jboss.idm.cfg.xml</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <para>datasource file, say idm-ds.xml</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <para>hibernate cfg file, say jboss.idm.hibernate.cfg.xml.</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>With regard to the detail of jboss idm configuration file, you can refer to the configuration documentation.</para>
         <para>So, if we want to deploy the idm into container with a specified JNDI name, we need to have a deployment
            file to define the JNDI and other neccessary properties.</para>
         <para>
            For the integration with JBoss AS5, the AS5 has a great deployment feature, we've built our own deployer to
            extend it, so that the AS can listen on the -jboss-idm.xml suffix file to start the IdentitySessionFactory.
         </para>
         <para>
            Basically, we had two deployer, one is: IDMConfigParsingDeployer class, which is taking responsible for
            parsing files that ends with the -jboss-idm.xml suffix into Java object. The other is: IDMDeployer class,
            this one is to do the real job, which means it might populate the schema, initial dataset into target db,
            and then start the IdentitySessionFactory, register it into the JNDI with the specified name at last.
         </para>
         <para>
            We will see a very typical deployment file looks like. (default-jboss-idm.xml)

            Once you've deployed the idm into JBoss AS5, by using the distribution. It will copy the idm-deployer
            into the JBoss AS5/server/$config/deployers folder, and the idm folder into the JBoss AS5/server/$config/deploy
            folder, which contains the default configuration files, like the jboss.idm.cfg.xml, idm-ds.xml etc.
